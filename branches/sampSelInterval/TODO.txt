TODO list

Ott  (current):

* Better error messages for formulas

* modularize tobit type detection

* permit user to specify type.  Create type consistency check

* merge treatReg to selection with suitable type

* re-write 'treatReg' as a frontend to 'selection(...,
  type='treatment') 

* consistent NA handling for selection: model frames should include
  the correct # of observations

* predict.treatReg(..., type="conditional") to work


Ott (long term):

* binary outcome prediction

* tobit5 binary outcome

* binary treatment effects

* better start values for probit

* think about tobit models as different classes, inheriting from a
  common base class
