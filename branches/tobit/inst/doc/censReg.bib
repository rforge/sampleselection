  abstract = {Advances in computing power allow the empirical researcher to use
  intensive computional techniques to solve and estimate nonlinear panel-data
  models, specifically those arising from nonlinear panel data such as Probit
  and Tobit models. In these cases, maximum-likelihood estimation can be
  cumbersome if not analytically intractable, requiring a T-variate multiple
  integration whose numerical approximation can sometimes be very poor.
  Different solutions are offered based variously on integral approximation
  through simulation, some form of Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), or
  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This paper compares the outcomes of
  those methods available in standard econometric packages, providing
  illustrations among prepackaged algorithms and a MCMC Gibbs sampler for
  nonlinear panel data. Using Chib (1992) and Chib and Carlin (1999), I derive
  a sampler for Probit/Tobit panel data and provide easy-to-use software for
  implementing the Gibbs sampler in panel data with discrete/limited dependent
  variable. I show that, when dealing with a large dataset, MCMC methods may
  replace the procedures provided in standard econometric packages.}
