TODO for mvProbit paper:

* O: read about mv probit, related marginal effects etc 

* Speed up the mvProbit 

** at least analyze if that can be done

*** in bivariate case maybe?

** what about gradients, hessian?

* implement prediction Pr(Y1=0, Y2=0), Pr(Y1=0, Y2=1), etc.

* use "predict" method instead of mvProbitExp?

** design the corresponding API

* look at API:

** allow for different models for different Y-s (model like a list of
   different formulas)

** allow to model rho (can this be done easily on 3+ dimensional
   case)?  Would be an interesting option, I don't know any other
   package supporting this.

*** Is this identified?
