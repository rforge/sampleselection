  abstract = {Advances in computing power allow the empirical researcher to use
  intensive computional techniques to solve and estimate nonlinear panel-data
  models, specifically those arising from nonlinear panel data such as Probit
  and Tobit models. In these cases, maximum-likelihood estimation can be
  cumbersome if not analytically intractable, requiring a T-variate multiple
  integration whose numerical approximation can sometimes be very poor.
  Different solutions are offered based variously on integral approximation
  through simulation, some form of Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), or
  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This paper compares the outcomes of
  those methods available in standard econometric packages, providing
  illustrations among prepackaged algorithms and a MCMC Gibbs sampler for
  nonlinear panel data. Using Chib (1992) and Chib and Carlin (1999), I derive
  a sampler for Probit/Tobit panel data and provide easy-to-use software for
  implementing the Gibbs sampler in panel data with discrete/limited dependent
  variable. I show that, when dealing with a large dataset, MCMC methods may
  replace the procedures provided in standard econometric packages.}

  abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of Heckman-type sample
  selection models in R. We discuss the sample selection problem as well as the
  Heckman solution to it, and argue that although modern econometrics has non-
  and semiparametric estimation methods in its toolbox, Heckman models are an
  integral part of the modern applied analysis and econometrics syllabus. We
  describe the implementation of these models in the package sampleSelection
  and illustrate the usage of the package on several simulation and real data
  examples. Our examples demonstrate the effect of exclusion restrictions,
  identification at infinity and misspecification. We argue that the package
  can be used both in applied research and teaching.}
