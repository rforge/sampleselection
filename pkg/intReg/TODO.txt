* common boundaries and point observations

* clustering-robust vcov

* fixed parameters: activePar[iBoundary] = FALSE.  What happens?

* point estimates for other distributions

* .polrY1 etc: review and probably remove in the code

* hessian( boundaries=FALSE)

* test for very large disturbance terms

* compute 'generalized disturbances': ^u = E(epsilon|interval, x)

* compute y^ = y* + ^u
