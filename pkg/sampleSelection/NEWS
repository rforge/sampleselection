THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "sampleSelection" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


   CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-2 (2014-06-24)

* changed/simplified a few examples in order to reduce their execution time


   CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-0 (2014-06-24)

* bug fix: selection() did not pass some arguments to other functions, e.g.
argument "inst" was ignored so that the second step of heckit-2 models was
estimated by OLS rather than by IV estimation although argument "inst" was
specified

* fixed bug in residuals.selection( , part = "selection" ) that occured when
the dependent variable of the selection model was a factor

* fixed bug that made residuals( object, part = "outcome" ) not work if
"object" was a sample selection model with a constructed variable
(e.g. "log(wage)") estimated by ML

* residuals.selection( , part = "outcome" ) now works for models with binary
dependent outcome variables

* probit models, tobit-2 models, and binary selection models can now be
estimated with observation-specific weights

* in case of a binary dependent variable of the outcome equation,
fitted( object, part = "outcome" ) now returns the probabilities rather than
the linear prdictors

* added a predict() method for probit models

* added a logLik() method for probit models

* added nobs() and nObs() methods for probit and selection models

* added argument "maxMethod" to heckit2fit() and heckit5fit() that specifies
the maximisation method that is used for estimating the probit model (1st stage)

* the default df.residual() method works for probit models

* this package no longer depends on package 'systemfit' but it imports function
systemfit from package "systemfit"

* minor adjustments in invMillsRatio() so that it works with bivariate
probit models estimated by the current version of the VGAM package (0.9-4)

* improved documentation

* modified some internal calculations so that they are numerically nore stable 

* removed the deprecated function tobit2()


   CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7-2 (2012-08-14)

* fixed a bug in the calculation of the Hessian of the log likelihood function 
for probit models that only occurred in specific circumstances
(reported by Jon K. Peck) 

* in Tobit 5 models, argument "outcome" can now be a pre-defined list 
(bug reported by Jon K. Peck) 


	CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7-0 (2012-03-04)

* Binary-outcome selection models


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-12 (2011-11-13)

* fixed a bug that occurred in the fitted( ..., part = "outcome" ), 
model.matrix( ..., part = "outcome" ), and model.frame() methods as well as 
in selection( ..., method = "model.frame" ) if all regressors of the outcome 
equation are already included in the selection equation. Thanks to TimothÃ©e 
Carayol for reporting this bug!

* fixed partial argument matching in invMillsRatio() and probit()


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-10

* added a NAMESPACE file

* minor modifications so that the sampleSelection package works with the
versions >= 0.7-3 of the maxLik package 



            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-8 AND BEFORE

* please take a look at the log messages of the SVN repository on R-Forge
